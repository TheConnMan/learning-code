Web Lession 2 - Make A Web Page
=========

You're gonna make a web page. It's going to be ugly. It's ok.

**Disclaimer:** These lessions will provide you with an opportunity to learn how to learn (read: "I'm not going to walk you through step by step, [Google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+write+the+codez) it"). These lessons will provide you with milestones and motivation to help keep you on track as you teach yourself to code.

### File Endings

It's very helpful to be able to change the file extension on a file (e.g. **Untitled.txt** to **Untitled.html**). This ususally isn't enabled on Windows and maybe Mac, so Google "enable file extension change" and follow the instructions.

## My First Web Page

1. Make a file called **Webpage.html** (make a new document and change the file ending)
2. Open it in your editor
3. Type something
4. Open the file with your browser
5. Profit

That's it, you made a web page. Yeah, the URL looks a little odd, but edit the file, refresh the page, and the changes will be there. You're a web developer, Harry.

## Some Tags

HTML is all about tags. If you just type a bunch of words into your new HTML file it probably doesn't look great. Add the following to your web page.

```
<html>
	<body>

	</body>
</html>
```

Those are some pretty standard tags which mark your page as an HTML page. You'll notice each tag has a closing tag (the tag with a **/**). All tags which get opened must be closed. The one exception is tags that look like `<this />` which are empty tags.

Start adding additional things in between the `<body></body>` tags. Play around with the following tags. They are very common and will get you 80% there in terms of useful HTML tags.

- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ...`<h6>`
- `<div>`
- `<a>`
- `<b>`
- `<button>`
- `<img>`
- `<ul>`
- `<ol>`
- `<li>`
- `<p>`
- `<select>`
- `<option>`
- `<span>`
- `<table>`
- `<th>`
- `<tr>`
- `<td>`
- `<u>`

Pretty standard stuff. Some of those won't make sense without others (table rows don't make much sense if they're not in a table), so look them up if they don't make sense.

## Replication

This Markdown viewer looks an awful lot like HTML...... =|

Well it is.

**Fun Fact:** Markdown is so cool because it takes plain text and converts it to HTML. It gets a little fancy (code blocks, table of contents, horizontal lines) but at it's core it's just plain HTML with some styling.

### Assignment

Replicate as much of this rendered Markdown as possible. Copying and pasting the text over is ok, just make sure you get the headers to look right, that you have an unordered list, a few paragraphs, and some bolding. The point is to try out some tags and learn how to convert tags and send them back from whence they came. Don't worry about the table of contents or code blocks.

And by the way...

## End

You made a web page with some stuff. Things can get much more complicated, but at its core this is web development. The rest is just stuff built on top.

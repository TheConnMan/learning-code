Web Lession 1 - Install All The Things
=========

This lesson is fairly boring, but necessary: installing things.

**Estimated time** - 15-30 min

[TOC]

## Prereqs

None, but the more software you have installed the faster this will go.

## Markdown

I'm not sure what you're reading this in if you don't have a Markdown editor (maybe it's on the web).

### Haroopad

[Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/user.html) is awesome and I love it.

## Editor

Below are two choices for editor. You'll only need one, but both are good to have.

### Groovy/Grails Tool Suite (GGTS)

[GGTS](http://spring.io/tools/ggts) is an Integrated Development Environment which will be helpful in other tutorials. It's also got syntax highlighting and other nice stuff. It's just like Eclipse, so if you want that instead go for it. GGTS also requires a [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) so you'll need one of those too.

### Notepad++

If you want to go lean you can download [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) instead. All we'll be doing is editing files so a regular editor works fine. Notepad++ is nice to have anyways.

## Web Server

We should install a server to serve up the web pages we'll be building. We don't technically need a server (we could just directly open the files in a browser), but it will be nice and will help us down the road.

### XAMPP

[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is a basic Apache web server along with few other helpful tools.

## End

You've now got all you need to start writing some web pages. It didn't end up being that many things.
